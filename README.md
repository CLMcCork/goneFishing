# goneFishing
A web app that helps you find, rate, and review the best fishing holes. 🐟🐠🐡🎣


This is still a work in progress, but check out what I've done so far here: https://fathomless-reef-43279.herokuapp.com/fishingholes
Feel free to poke around and add your own fishing holes/reviews. I'll be updating this from time to time as I learn more, so stay tuned for updates! 


Languages/tools I used: 
-HTML 5
-CSS 3 
-JavaScript 
-ExpressJS
-NodeJS
-EJS 
-Mongoose
-MongoDB
-Bootstrap 
-Lots of npms 🙌
-Git


Things I learned while working on this project: 
1. Coding is hard (I alreay knew this 😊). Coding is also extremely fun! 🎉🤓 (Somthing I already knew as well, but it's worth pointing these statements out as a reminder to my future self to KEEP GOING!). 
2. It's tough to estimate how long things will take to get done when you are a newbie. A seemingly "easy" task can take hours. 
3. Beware of the rabbit holes when researching!  
4. One of the best ways to solve a bug is to take a break, a walk, or just sleep on it. A new perspective is always helpful. 
5. Learning is a community driven activity. There are so many helpful resources, videos, mentors, and documents out there in the tech field. As I grow and learn more, I hope to become a resource for others and lend an ear for anyone that needs to rubber duck a bug. 


Things I would like to improve/add to this project: (putting this here for accountability 💪 ) 
-not a fan of the mobile layout-fix this! 
-make sure mapbox, pins, and fishingholes show up on index page when on mobile 
-infinite scroll on reviews page? (in case there are lots of reviews for a fishing hole) 
-add pagination on index page
-maybe add a thumbnail image or number of stars (from review) to the popup box (And remove hyperlink? so it looks better) 
-on home page, move nav bar brand to far left and links to far right of page? improve the look of this page  
-Rock Salt google fonts for title (issue w/ CSP not accepting it--need to research) 
-the edit/delete option looks weird—need to fix when deleting a photo 
-fish favicon for tab 
-make sure everything is accessible!! (and also make sure works in different browsers) 
-include some of my seed data so there are more pins on the map/more fishing holes on index page
-add a search bar to search for a fishing hole 
-create a password reset option 
-option to pay for fishing hole fee w/in the app--is there a free payment api? how to test this b/c don't want to take real payments (this is not a business page)?  -host project on my website--need to change the heroku link to include my domain (figure this out) 


Finally, I'd like to thank Colt Steele, the instructor for the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. I just finished his course on July 22, 2021. My Gone Fishing project was based off of the YelpCamp project in Colt's course. I learned so much from his course, doing YelpCamp, and then working on this project. I'm excited to keep learning and to begin my next coding adventure!
